Local attractions include a hidden unspoilt cove (making it perfect for a quiet getaway!). There is no commercialism here, but lots of history: from saxon treasure found in the hills nearby, to smuggling, fishing and iron ore mining. Pigeon racing is a major local past time and on 5th November there is an amazing bonfire on the beach, watched by thousands.

The Cleveland Way runs along the shore, making it perfect for dog walkers. We are also centrally located for Whitby, Staithes, Saltburn-by-the-Sea and the Yorkshire moors.

Moonfleet is easily commutable for those working at TATA Steel, Pot Ash and Caterpillar.

All rooms are newly renovated to a high standard, have en-suite bathrooms, flat screen TVs and tea and coffee making facilities.

There is a private bar, pool table room and free car park.

Afternoon tea, packed lunches, evening meals and on site laundry service are available upon request.

Visitors with dogs welcome - please contact for prior arrangements.
