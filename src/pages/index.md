Local attractions include a hidden unspoilt cove (making it perfect for a quiet getaway!). There is no commercialism here, but lots of history: from saxon treasure found in the hills nearby, to smuggling, fishing and iron ore mining. Pigeon racing is a major local past time and on 5th November there is an amazing bonfire on the beach, watched by thousands. Skinningrove is a village centrally located for the tourist hot spots of Whitby, Staithes, Saltburn-by-the-Sea and the Yorkshire moors.

Moonfleet is situated 5 minutes walk from the Cleveland Way; ideally positioned as a stopover for walkers. The local beach (Cattersty Sands) is largely unpopulated and has no restrictions for dogs all year round - please see our Dogs page for more information on their stay at Moonfleet. 

All rooms are newly renovated to a high standard, have en-suite bathrooms, flat screen TVs and tea and coffee making facilities.
