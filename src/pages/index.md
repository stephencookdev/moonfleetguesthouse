Local attractions include a hidden unspoilt cove (making it perfect for a quiet getaway!). There is no commercialism here, but lots of history: from saxon treasure found in the hills nearby, to smuggling, fishing and iron ore mining. Pigeon racing is a major local past time and on 5th November there is an amazing bonfire on the beach, watched by thousands.

Moonfleet is situated 5 minutes walk from the Cleveland Way, making it a perfect overnight stopover for walkers. Our local beach is unrestricted, making it perfect for visitors with dogs. Skinningrove is a village centrally located for the tourist hot spots of Whitby, Staithes, Saltburn-by-the-Sea and the Yorkshire moors.

All rooms are newly renovated to a high standard, have en-suite bathrooms, flat screen TVs and tea and coffee making facilities.

There is a private bar, pool table room and free car park.
