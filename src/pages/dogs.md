      Dogs are welcome to stay upon request, however there is an extra charge of
      Â£6 per dog, per night to allow for extra cleaning.


      Hot and cold water taps are available outside for muddy paws and we have a list of local dog friendly places to eat in the rooms. 


      We ask our furry friends' parents to bring a dog bed with them, as we don't allow dogs on the furniture. 


      The local beach is unrestricted at all times of the year, which is perfect for a trip to the sea for a doggy paddle!


      Please contact us directly to request a stay with your dog.
